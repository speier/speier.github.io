[DotCloud](https://www.dotcloud.com) is a totally awesome PaaS (Platform as a Service) supporting multiple components. They have a command line tool written in Python to acces their services (create, deploy, push, etc.), but they actually all run Linux or OS X and they don't have an official installer for Windows.

So I have created a simple installer to setup DotCloud CLI (Command-Line Interface) on Windows. The setup includes all prerequisites (Python, Cygwin, etc.) to run DotCloud.
